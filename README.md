NLP also known as Natural Language Processing is one of the main ingredient in Artificial Intelligence(AI). It is often used in converting and processing of textual data coming from pdfs, websites, other documents which includes resumes, health record,etc.
It is important that the data available from these records should be cleaned, processed and stored properly in on-premise or cloud based storage locations where safety of data is ensured.
